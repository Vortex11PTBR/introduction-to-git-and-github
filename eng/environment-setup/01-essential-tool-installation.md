# Essential Tool Installation

For a complete and efficient development environment with Git, it is recommended to install the following tools:

- **Git Bash**: A terminal that emulates the Linux environment on Windows, including Git and basic Unix commands. Essential for Windows users.
- **Virtual Box**: Virtualization software that allows running operating systems (like Ubuntu) within your main operating system.
- **Ubuntu (Linux)**: A popular Linux distribution, ideal for development, which can be installed in a virtual machine via Virtual Box.

## Where to Install

It is recommended to download and install these tools directly from the **official websites** of each project to ensure the latest and most secure versions.

## Code Editor Configuration (VS Code)

For a better experience with Markdown files and general development, **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is highly recommended. After installation:

1. Install the `zaaack.markdown-editor` extension.
2. Use `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and search for "Markdown: Open Preview to the Side" to view your Markdown file edits in real-time.
