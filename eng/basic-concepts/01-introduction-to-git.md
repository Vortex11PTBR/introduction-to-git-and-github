# Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system**. Its main function is to track changes in files, especially in software development projects. It allows multiple developers to work collaboratively and in an organized manner.

With Git, it is possible to:

- Maintain a complete history of all modifications.
- Revert files or the entire project to a previous state.
- Create branches to develop new features in isolation.
- Compare and merge different versions of the same file.
- Work offline, synchronizing changes later with a remote repository.
